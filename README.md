Another fun exercise. So this demo is about key sequence detection.

Every time you type, you're entering a key...we want to match something you type to a pre-determined sequence.

The page will be blank, but start typing...once the correct sequence of keys is entered, stuff will start appearing on the page. Plus you can check the console for confirmation.
